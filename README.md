This repository contains final code for Crypto Tracker Application in ReactJS. The data is pulled with coingecko's api. I learned so much on this project, Major shout out to code bucks for being a great mentor<br />

TODO
Click on tabs to view the different options. The filter drop down with drill the data ascending or descending depending on your selection. Please utilize the search to display a desired token. I have made this website responsive for mobile use, tailwinds helped with that. The trending tab gives you the latest top 8 crypto currency being sold. The favorite tab will display any token you add the highlighted star on. This would be your favorite tab and it will be saved on that list.

The circle button on the top bar will bring the window back to default home screen. When you click on any crypto currency symbol name you will be presented with a popup window with all the crypto token details. Here you will see a chart graph with points of price changes. I have also displayed all links to the crypto currency websites and info.

The website is powered by coin gecko api.CoinGecko provides a fundamental analysis of the crypto market. In addition to tracking price, volume and market, CoinGecko tracks community growth, open-source code development, major events and on-chain metrics.
